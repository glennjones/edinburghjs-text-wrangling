# Edinburghjs talk - Text Wrangling and Machine Learning - 23 March 2023

__Talk description:__

More organisations are looking to automate tasks and gain insights from large amounts of text. JavaScript is a powerful language for text wrangling and machine learning, allowing developers to quickly and easily manipulate text data. We will look at different approaches from rules-based parsing to neural nets.

Exploring what JavaScript frameworks, workflows and processes are available to build real world apps. This is a gentle introduction which should be interesting and useful to all JavaScript coders.

## Slides
The sildes are in the repo `slides.pdf`

## Code and examples

To view and play with the notebooks you will need to install the [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.typescript-notebook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.typescript-notebook) plugin for Visual Code.  __Note:__ without Visual Code and the typescript-notebook pluging the notebook files `.nnb` will just be displayed as JSON data. It is also worth installing the Jupier Notebooks plugin into Visual Code.

Once you have done the above then clone the git repo onto your local machine and do a npm install in the cloned directory Open the project in Visual Code and you should be able to play with the examples in the note books.
